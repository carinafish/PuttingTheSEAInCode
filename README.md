# PuttingTheSEAInCode 
This repository holds the materials for the [#BlackInMarineScience](https://blackinmarsci.github.io/index.html#) week, #PuttingTheSEAInCode intro to R workshop taking place on Friday December 4th, 2020. Register [here](https://tnc.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJMqcuysrjMqHNbmUWs5fxKNCbQdR5KzJAMy).

If you plan to participate in #PuttingTheSEAIncode, and have not done so already please download [R](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) and [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/). You will need both programs. Since this is an interactive workshop you will get the most out of it if these programs are installed prior to the start of the workshop.

If at anytime during the workshop you lose track of where we are in the woekshop please use the links below to follow along:
1) You can find the introduction slides [here](WeCanCode_presentation_copy copy.html).
2) Follow the R coding portion using the instructions [here](SEAInCodeRIntro2.html).

If you have any questions after the workshop feel free to email us: latreese.denson@gmail.com and/or davis.chanted@gmail.com. You can also visit the GitHub page for this repository to see the raw Rmarkdown files and use them as a base to start your own R projects.
